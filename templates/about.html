    <p>A custom Hearthstone library where users can view card sets, create and update their own collections.
    <p>Users can keep track of which cards from which sets they are still missing, or how many copies of a single card
        they own.</p>
    <p>The library already supports a few sets and new sets will be added as they are released by Blizzard.</p>
